## Multi-Agent Web Research & Summarization Pipeline

## Overview

- Developed an autonomous multi-agent web research and summarization system that performs end-to-end research on user-specified topics.
- Implements a collaborative Planner → Searcher → Synthesizer → Critic workflow coordinated by a Supervisor for intelligent task orchestration.
- Uses a Message Bus (Redis Streams or an in-memory) to enable asynchronous communication between independent agents.
- Generates citation-backed research reports by retrieving, synthesizing, and validating information from multiple sources

## Setup

Clone Repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/TirumalaSrividya/multi-agent-web-research-pipeline.git
cd multi-agent-research-pipeline
```

Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install pytest
```

**Run Pipeline**

Run locally without docker

```
python -m src.main --topics-file sample_topics.json --output-dir outputs
```

Run a single topic:
```
python -m src.main \
    --topic "Impact of AI on labor markets" \
    --depth deep \
    --output-dir outputs
```
or 

Run with Docker

linux/mac

GNU Make is installed:
```
make run
```

Windows PowerShell

Windows does not include GNU Make by default. Run the equivalent commands manually:
```
docker compose build
docker compose up -d redis
docker compose run --rm app
docker compose down
```


**Running Tests**
```
pytest
 ```
or
```
make test
```

## Mock Search Backend

It uses a synthetic search dataset (~10,000 documents) spanning multiple domains such as AI, healthcare, climate, and energy. Documents are ranked using a simple keyword-overlap algorithm, enabling search, ranking, and citation functionality without requiring internet access or external search APIs.

## Current Limitations
- Uses a synthetic search dataset instead of live web search.
- Search ranking is based on keyword overlap rather than    semantic retrieval.
- Reports are currently exported only in JSON format; PDF generation is planned for future enhancement.
